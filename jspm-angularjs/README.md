# DevExtreme with JSPM and AngularJS example

This [AngularJS](https://angularjs.org/) example displays DevExtreme widgets loading only required modules. The application contains a button (a [dxButton](https://js.devexpress.com/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Components/dxButton/) widget). When you click this button, an [alert dialog](https://js.devexpress.com/Documentation/ApiReference/Common/Utils/ui/dialog/#alertmessageHtml_title) appears. The example requires [JSPM](http://jspm.io/) package manager to be installed.
